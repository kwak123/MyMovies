This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb. <br/>
Remade due to sensitive information on last <br/>
Place your TMDB API key in the app's build.gradle file <br/>
Will need to add documentation to the code, TBD after completing DetailsFragment. <br/>
Most of my code was taken directly from the Android documentation and previous Udacity courses.<br/>

Please note I selected a high minimum-SDK of 21, so that I could support the nifty new animations allowed in Honeycomb, but I am not yet confident enough in myself to allow for both those animations and providing support for previous versions of Android. Though they are not yet implemented, I plan on doing so in stage 2 of the project.
